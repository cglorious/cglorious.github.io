Like many software engineering students entering bootcamp after one (or more) career(s) later, the big question I'm asked often is this: *So, why software engineering?*

To that I answer... **why not?**

### Dreaming in the Concrete Jungle

I'd like to say the reason that I chose the road less traveled towards software engineering is because I grew up near the Silicon Valley. Potentially yes, but short answer - nope. My curiousity for technology (and eventually code) started in one of my survivor jobs in New York City. It's true - it really is the concrete jungle where dreams are made of.

### Once a Teacher... Forever an Artist...

To give you a little background, I took the safe route after my undergraduate, and entered into the world of education. I taught in a range of public and private school environments, in both California and New York. Regardless of the age I taught, I found myself yearning for a challenge. What can I say, I operate on a growth mindset (note: that's teacher talk).

While teaching, I performed in musical theatre, and eventually found myself gaining my Equity card (hooray!), which led me to New York. As many thriving and surviving artists understand, it's necessary to have at least two, maybe three, and perhaps four survivor jobs at any given time. 

Lucky for me, one of my survivor jobs was in tech.

### Engineering Aspirations

As part of my job duties, I managed large scales auction events and galas, and helped clients manage guests through a software system. As I learned how to navigate and teach the software to clients, I became more curious about the software, about engineering, and about tech. Eventually, my curiousity led me to software engineering... because why not?

So to all of you non-traditional, didn't-go-to-school-for-Computer-Science, maybe-I'm-too-old-for-this prospective engineering students out there... I urge you to ask yourself... **why not?**
